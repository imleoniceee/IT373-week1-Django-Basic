While working on my first Assignment1 involving Python, VS Code, and Django, I learned several important steps to set up the development environment and run the server successfully. Initially, I faced multiple challengesâ€”especially errors in the terminal and issues with writing the correct scripts to execute commands properly. Sometimes, even a small typo in the command line would prevent the server from running. To overcome these problems, I asked for help from my classmates, which was really helpful. One key thing I discovered was the importance of checking the code carefully for syntax errors or missing configurations. Debugging became a valuable skill during this process. Although it was a long and sometimes frustrating experience, I found it rewarding to explore new setups and tools. Watching tutorials and listening to discussions from our professor also helped me understand the workflow better. I became more familiar with virtual environments, Django commands like python manage.py runserver, and how to manage project files. Overall, this assignment taught me not just technical skills, but also the importance of collaboration, patience, and continuous learning in programming.
